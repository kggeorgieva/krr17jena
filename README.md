Jena examples

Jena is a Java API which can be used to create and manipulate RDF graphs.
Jena has object classes to represent graphs, resources, properties and literals.
The interfaces representing resources, properties and literals are called Resource, Property and Literal respectively.
In Jena, a graph is called a model and is represented by the model interface.
